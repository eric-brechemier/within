within is a factory of semi-private spaces  
where properties and events can be shared.

API
---

Function: within( name, callback )  
Create a semi-private space to share properties and events

This function allows to create modules that span multiple source files
before concatenation.

  // module1-part1.js
  within( "example.org/module1", function( get, set, publish, subscribe ) {
    // definition of module 1, part 1
  });

  // module1-part2.js
  within( "example.org/module1", function( get, set, publish, subscribe ) {
    // definition of module 1, part 2
  });

  // module1-part3.js
  within( "example.org/module1", function( get, set, publish, subscribe ) {
    // definition of module 1, part 3
  });

A module is identified by a domain name and a path forming the module name
which roughly corresponds to a space where you would be able to publish
contents on the Web (although you don't have to):

  "example.tld/hypothetic/path/to/module"

The intent is to avoid clashes with modules defined by different people and
organizations, or even yourself in the future.

The callback function runs immediately, within the context of an object
that holds data for the module; the same object is provided in all parts
of the module:

  within( "example.org/module1", function( get, set, publish, subscribe ) {
    // 'this' refers to semi-private module data
  });

Four functions are provided as arguments to the callback to interact with
data and publish events within the confines of this shared symbolic space:

* get( name ) - get the value of a property in module data
* set( name, value ) - set the value of a property in module data
* publish( name, value ) - set the value of a property and publish an event
* subscribe( name, listener ) - subscribe to an event published in the module

The get() and set() functions simply get and set properties in the module
data, without publishing any event. Since the data object can also be
accessed as '`this`' in the callback function, properties can also be set
and retrieved directly.

The advantage of get() over direct access through '`this`' is that it only
retrieves the value of *own* properties stored directly in the data object,
and not the value of properties *inherited* from the Object prototype chain,
which allows to use the data object as a hash, without tripping on
[special names such as 'constructor' or 'hasOwnProperty'][OBJECT_PROTOTYPE].

[OBJECT_PROTOTYPE]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype

A disadvantage of get() compared with direct access through '`this`' is
that it does not provide any means to differentiate between an unset value
and a value explicitly set to null. In both cases, get() returns null:

  set( "property1", null );
  get( "property1" ) === null; // true

  // property2 has never been set
  get( "property2" ) === null; // true

get() only returns 'undefined' if the value 'undefined' is set explicitly:

  set( "property3", undefined );
  get( "property3" ) === undefined; // true

But this feature can also be seen as an advantage, and results from a
deliberate design decision, to make the data object behave more like a hash
and allow a stronger comparison of value with the `===` operator instead
of a weaker comparison using `==` operator which results in type coercion.

There is no particular advantage of set() compared with directly setting
a value through '`this`', except that the set() function remains accessible
in all functions defined within the callback function provided as argument
to within(), unlike '`this`' which varies as the calling context of each
function changes:

  within( "example.org/module1", function( get, set, publish, subscribe ){

    // 'this' refers to module data
    // get() and set() allow to get/set properties in module data

    function innerFunction() {
      // 'this' no longer refers to module data
      // get() and set() still allow to get/set properties in module data
    }

    innerFunction();
  });

The publish() function notifies registered listeners of the occurrence of
an event in the module together with the current value of the associated
property. A common use case is to call publish() twice in a row,
with a verb in the active form and the same verb in passive form:

  publish( "start", {
    // configuration properties
  });
  publish( "started", true );

Listeners for "start" may process provided data in turn while listeners
for "started" will get notified once the processing completes:

  subscribe( "start", function( config ) {
    // configure some behavior using provided properties
  });

  subscribe( "started", function() {
    // start using the configured behavior
  });

The value of the event is also set to the property of the same name:

  subscribe( "start", function( config ) {
    // get( "start" ) === config; // true
  });

When no value is provided in the call to publish(), it defaults to the
boolean value true:

  publish( "started" );

  subscribe( "started", function() {
    // get( "started" ) === true; // true
    // start using the configured behavior
  });

When a listener is registered for an event while the property of the same
name has already been set, subscribe() fires the listener immediately
without waiting for the next call to publish():

  publish( "started" );

  subscribe( "started", function( value ) {
    // called immediately with the current value of the property:
    // get( "started" ) === true;
  });

As a side effect, this is also the case when the property has only been
set and never published before:

  // no call to publish( "started" ) before
  set( "started", true );

  subscribe( "started", function( value ) {
    // called immediately with the current value of the property:
    // get( "started" ) === true;
  });

For convenience, '`this`' also refers to the module data object in listeners
for events of the module:

  subscribe( "start", function() {
    // 'this' refers to the module data
    this.score = 0;
  });

As a shortcut, within() can also be called without callback, to retrieve
an object with the four methods get, set, publish, and subscribe:

  {
    get: function( name ){ /* ... */ },
    set: function( name, value ){ /* ... */ },
    publish: function( name, value ){ /* ... */ },
    subscribe: function( name, listener ){ /* ... */ }
  }

This shorter pattern is intended for use in debugging:

  console.log( within( "example.org/game" ).get( "score" ) );
  within( "example.org/game" ).set( "score", 0 );
  within( "example.org/game" ).subscribe( "bonus", function( bonus ){
    console.log( bonus );
  });
  within( "example.org/game" ).publish( "bonus", 100 );

The above form is more redundant but easier to type in the console,
due to reduced indentation level compared with the equivalent form below:

  within( "example.org/game", function( get, set, publish, subscribe ){
    console.log( get( "score" ) );
    set( "score", 0 );
    subscribe( "bonus", function( bonus ){
      console.log( bonus );
    });
    publish( "bonus", 100 );
  });

The shorter form is also useful when interacting with a module from within
another module:

  within( "example.org/test", function( get, set, publish, subscribe ){

    var game = within( "example.org/game" );

    game.subscribe( "bonus", function( bonus ){
      var score = game.get( "score" );
      game.set( "score", score + bonus );
    });

    game.publish( "bonus", 100 );

  });

The short form above is more readable due to reduced nesting, and less
confusing than the longer form below which uses the same function names
get, set, publish, subscribe for the methods of two different modules:

  within( "example.org/test", function( get, set, publish, subscribe ){
    // get, set, publish, subscribe are methods of module "example.org/test"

    within( "example.org/game", function( get, set, publish, subscribe ){
      // get, set, publish, subscribe are methods of "example.org/game"

      subscribe( "bonus", function( bonus ){
        var score = get( "score" );
        set( "score", score + bonus );
      });

      publish( "bonus", 100 );
    });

  });
